            <li class="info">Whenever you see a card displayed to the right (2-6) press the right arrow key to add +1 to the count.</li>
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">Whenever you see a card displayed to the left (10-A) press the left arrow key to minus -1 to the count.</li>
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">To be fast enough to use this in a live session, practice negating.  (e.g.  Ace and 4 negates to Zero)</li>

           <br>
           <li class="info">Cards not shown are intentionally unlisted (7-9) because they have a count of 0.</li>
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">Ideally, you want to start the count at the beginning of the shoe otherwise the count won't be completely accurate.</li>
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">If the count goes to above +8 increase bets, if the count goes to 10 and above (and is closer to the middle/end of the shoe) bet large</li>
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">If there are less cards in the shoe, the count is more accurate and gives a bigger advantage. (E.G. a +8 count at the beginning of the shoe has a higher variance than a +8 count near the end of the shoe)</li> 
           <br>
           <br>
           <li class="info">Counting cards does not guarantee a win, it just reduces the house edge and potentially gives you a statistical advantage.</li>
